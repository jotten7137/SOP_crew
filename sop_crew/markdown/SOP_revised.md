Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Making Slime:

Ingredients:
- 1 cup of white school glue
- 1 cup of water
- Food coloring
- Contact lens solution
- Baking soda

Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of white school glue and 1 cup of water. Mix well until fully incorporated.
2. Add a few drops of food coloring of your choice to the glue mixture. Stir until the color is evenly distributed.
3. In a separate small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of contact lens solution.
4. Slowly pour the baking soda and contact lens solution mixture into the colored glue mixture. Stir continuously as the slime begins to form.
5. Keep stirring and kneading the slime until it reaches the desired consistency. Add more contact lens solution if the slime is too sticky, or more baking soda if it is too runny.
6. Once the slime is ready, store it in an airtight container when not in use to prevent it from drying out.

Note:
- Always wash your hands before and after making slime.
- Do not ingest the slime, and keep it away from young children or pets.
- Dispose of slime properly in the trash when it is no longer desired.
