1. Gather all the necessary ingredients: white school glue, water, borax powder, food coloring (optional), and glitter (optional).
2. In a mixing bowl, pour out 1/2 cup of white school glue.
3. Add 1/2 cup of water to the glue and stir until well combined.
4. In a separate bowl, mix 1 teaspoon of borax powder with 1 cup of warm water until the borax is completely dissolved.
5. Slowly pour the borax mixture into the glue mixture while stirring continuously.
6. Keep stirring until the slime starts to form and pull away from the sides of the bowl.
7. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring and glitter to the slime mixture and continue to knead until fully incorporated.
8. Once the slime reaches the desired consistency, remove it from the bowl and knead it with your hands until smooth.
9. Store the slime in an airtight container when not in use to prevent it from drying out.
